# DateFile

DateFile is a file management application with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built using Electron, React, and Material-UI (MUI). It simplifies the process of finding files based on the date of another file, making file organization and retrieval easy.

I made this application to help me find old project files in a large and disorganized directory. Using the date of an exported file from the project I am able to find the project file. I also took this as an opportunity to learn electron.

The application addresses the common challenge of locating files associated with a specific date. With DateFile, you can effortlessly search for files that share the same date as a reference file of your choice. The intuitive and visually appealing interface enhances usability, making it easier to manage your files based on their dates.

## Key Features

**Intuitive GUI**: Benefit from a user-friendly interface that simplifies file management tasks.

**Date-based file search**: Easily locate files that have the same date as a specified reference file.

**Preview and selection**: Preview search results and selectively choose the files you want to work with.

**Enhanced file organization**: Streamline your file management workflow by efficiently organizing files by date.

## Disclaimer
